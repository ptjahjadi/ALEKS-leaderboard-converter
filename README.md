# ALEKS-leaderboard-converter
## Aim
This project aims to convert the datasets of ALEKS' weekly reports into a leaderboard, measuring time, learned and learned per hour for each student.
## Summary
ALEKS is a web-based assessment program aimed for teachers to determine topics for each student to learn, based on their competencies. By running through this code, each weekly dataset can be turned into a simple leaderboard, that ranks students based on learning time, topics learned, and topics learned per hour.
## Guide
* Leaderboard.ipynb provides the code to create the leaderboard, given an ALEKS weekly dataset.
The algorithm in which ALEKS works can be found in the Literature folder.
A sample report and leaderboard for each metric are also provided.
## Built With
* Python
## Special Thanks
